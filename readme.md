- The first usable public release will be 1.0.0.

Prerequisites:
- A working D compiler and Dub.

Usage:
- Add 'st_nexus_api' as a dependancy to your dub project file.
- Please also read the dub documentation for details.

# Intentions and Goals

This module aims to provide a library for DLang to access the Sonatype Nexus Repository API. This software
provides 'artifactory' functionalities for several types of data, package formats.

It uses a straight forward REST API to access, modify or administer the server.

I use Nexus at various places for my GitLab CI pipelines. To avoid to write the same code over and over again
I decided to put it into a global library.
